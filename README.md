### General Info

This project was developed for the mintbean Jr Developers Hiring Hackathons, July 2021. The prompt was to build a card game in either backend, frontend, or full-stack. I chose the front end to give myself more practice with javascript and to text my UI abilities.

### Process Work

1. Set up React environement and app framework.
2. Established functions and variable that would be used to create and randomize the deck.
